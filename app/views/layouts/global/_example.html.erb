            <h2>Welcome to Class</h2>
            <div>
                Welcome to CIDI 1010! I have been teaching this course for four years now, and I learn something new each semester. While this class is focused on creating a learning services agreement for teaching in higher education, I think you will find the principles will apply to many instructional contexts. I would like each student to create his or her own learning experience within the framework I have developed, so if you have ideas-- let's talk.<br /><br />
                Please take the time to review this learning services agreement thoroughly. It has all the information you need to be successful in this course. After you have read this document, if any part of the course is unclear, please email me.

            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <div>
                This accelerated online course will provide students with opportunities to learn the components of a SALSA: a <b><u>S</u></b>tyled & <b><u>A</u></b>ccessible <b><u>L</u></b>earning <b><u>S</u></b>ervices <b><u>A</u></b>greement. Students will explore their instructional strengths and weaknesses as indicated by an inventory of their personal beliefs, knowledge and practices. Students will create a SALSA that identifies course: Information, Outcomes, Resources, Activities, Policies and Grades. To conclude the course, each student will conduct an evaluation of another student's SALSA.

        <h2>Learning Activities</h2>
        <h3>Readings</h3>
        <div>
            We will read approximately one chapter from the textbook and one or two Additional Readings each week. Assignments related to the readings will alternate between a weekly quiz and a weekly discussion.
        </div>
        <h3>Video Presentations</h3>
        <div>
            Most weeks there will be an Instructor presentation related to the readings. You are expected to complete all readings before viewing the presentation. The presentation will be focused more on synthesis and expansion of the reading materials, so it is your responsibility to gain a basic understanding of the reading materials first.
        </div>
        <h3>Quizzes</h3>
        <div>
            You will be required to complete four "No-pressure Quizzes". These quizzes will consist of approximately ten multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching and/or true/false questions based on the readings and presentations. You are expected to complete all readings and view the presentation before you take the quiz. You must get ALL the quiz questions correct to receive ANY quiz points, but you may RETAKE the quiz as many times as you would like.
        </div>
        <h3>Discussions</h3>
        <div>
            You will participate in four Discussions on Canvas (one introduction and three regular). In order to earn the Discussion Points, you must post one message and two replies (where you reply to someone else's message) for each Discussion Topic.
        </div>
        <h3>Assignments</h3>
        <div>
            There will be six Assignments for this course: Personal Resources Inventory, Learning Service Agreements, Communication Strategies, Student Learning Strategies, Course SALSA and SALSA Evaluation. Complete information on these activities is available on Canvas. Please refer to the "Grading" section for the Assignment point values.<br /><br />
            Assignment files will be in PDF format. You will be able to add information to these files, and save a copy for submission. For more information, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uolYGsmxlE.<br /><br />

            I will be reading the Discussion Boards and replying to messages occasionally. You will receive specific feedback on your Assignments in the form of text comments appended to your electronic submissions.<br /><br />
            I will use the Announcements tool in Canvas to communicate changes to the course and other course information. For information on using the Announcements tool, view the video at http://podcasts.usu.edu/MediaPlayer/genplayer.html?filename=Podcasts/canvas/tutorials/AnnouncementsSubtitled.mov.<br /><br />

            If you experience a legitimate emergency (according to my standards) that will prevent you from completing required coursework on time, I expect you to communicate with me at the earliest reasonable opportunity. Please state the nature of the emergency, and when you expect to turn in the coursework.
        </div>
        <h3>SALSA Changes</h3>
        <div>
            I have made every effort to present accurate and complete information, but this SALSA is subject to changes. I will notify the class regarding all changes.<br /><br />
            In the event of any discrepancy between information in this SALSA and on Canvas, the information in CANVAS WILL TAKE PRECENDENCE.
