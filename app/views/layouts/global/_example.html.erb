            <div>
                Welcome to FACT 1010! I have been teaching this course for four years now, and I learn something new each semester. While this class is focused on creating a syllabus for teaching in higher education, I think you will find the principles will apply to many instructional contexts. I would like each student to create his or her own learning experience within the framework I have developed, so if you have ideas-- let's talk.<br /><br />
    Please take the time to review this syllabus thoroughly. It has all the information you need to be successful in this course. After you have read the syllabus, if any part of the course is unclear, please email me.

            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <div>
                This accelerated online course will provide students with opportunities to learn the components of a syllabus for online higher education courses. Students will explore their instructional strengths and weaknesses as indicated by an inventory of their personal beliefs, knowledge and practices. Students will create a syllabus that identifies their instructional objectives, resources and activities, and integrates a learning contract and a communication strategy. To conclude the course, each student will conduct an evaluation of another student's syllabus.

            You will be required to complete four "No-pressure Quizzes".
